## Course description

**Rationale**: It is impossible to understand the modern world without an understanding of statistics.  From public opinion polls to clinical trials in medicine to online systems that recommend purchases to us, statistics play a role in nearly every aspect of our lives. The goal of this course is to provide an understanding of the essential concepts and “big ideas” of statistics --- describing data and making decisions and predictions based on data -- as well as the skills to employ these concepts on real data to solve authentic problems. At the end of the course, students will possess:

- *Statistical literacy*: The ability to dissect and understand statistical claims in scientific research and popular media
- *Statistical ability*: The skills necessary to apply statistical analysis methods to real data
- *Statistical curiosity*: The interest in further developing their statistical skills and knowledge, and the confidence in their ability to do so

**Instructional philosophy**.  My instructional philosophy is based on the overwhelming scientific evidence that the standard instructional model  (a lecturer talking at students for a long period) is an ineffective way to instill lasting skills and knowledge.  Instead, I will aim for the course to be:

- *Active*: The learning experience should be more like a conversation than a one-directional transmission of content.
- *Evidence-based*: Frequent assessments will provide the instructors with ongoing information about student learning, so that we can base the progression of the course on data rather than subjective impressions.
- *Authentic*: We will engage with real data in all its messiness using real statistical tools, with the goal of learning how to solve real problems and how to avoid common missteps and pitfalls.

Statistics is a broad field, and the goal of this course is not “coverage” of the entire field or simple familiarity with the concepts. Instead, we will work towards a deep understanding and ability to apply a set of core concepts, and we will actively adjust the course based on the results from our ongoing assessments.

## Acknowledgment of Challenging Times

Students and instructors are all adjusting to the changes and regulations that have been put in place this year in response to COVID-19. We hope that we will all work together as a community to adapt to these times and this new situation as best as we can. We have tried to add flexibility to our course structure and assignments to accommodate anyone who may now be lacking resources they originally thought they would have available. If you find yourself facing additional challenges that make it difficult for you to keep up with the course work, please let me know and we can figure out a way to support you. We will not ask you to explain the details of your situation. So, please do not hesitate to reach out to any of the teaching team members. If you have suggestions for how we might better support your learning in this course, during these trying times, please do not hesitate to let us know. 


## Course structure

The course has been heavily remodeled for Winter 2021 to adapt it to a virtual learning environment.  The course will be focused around Canvas modules, with one module for each week. Each module will include:

- 1-2 chapters from the freely available online book
- 3-4 short (5-15 min) lecture videos
- Web-based R programming tutorials
- A quiz
- Every other week there will be a problem set due.
- Some modules will include milestones related to the final project.

The modules for the current week as well as the following two modules will be available on Canvas throughout the quarter.  This allows you to get ahead if needed, while still ensuring a spacing of learning across the quarter that is beneficial for learning.

There will be synchronous sessions via Zoom , lasting 50 minutes and starting at the scheduled class time (MWF, 10:30-11:20 AM PST); you can find the links to these sessions on Canvas. Each student will be expected to attend at least one of these per week, or complete a makeup assignment.  The synchronous sessions will follow a standard thematic organization each week:

- Monday: Hands-on exercises and group work
- Wednesday: Review of problem set (in weeks after a PSet was due), and coding exercises (including live coding by the professor and group coding exercises)
- Friday: Q&A (submitted by Google docs) and review of major concepts.

## Virtual learning: norms and expectations

In order to make the best of Zoom-based meetings, please observe the following guidelines:

- While you are not required to keep your video turned on during synchronous sessions, we ask that you keep it on if possible as it allows more personal connection between students and instructors.
- Keep yourself muted unless you are speaking.
- If you wish to speak, using the Raise Hand button in Zoom and wait to be called upon.
- Once you have finished speaking, please mute yourself and lower your hand.
- You may post questions to the Chat window.
- Please be very mindful about the use of private chats within Zoom; in general, don't write anything that you wouldn't want the entire class to see.  Remember, there is no delete button...

Note that you will need to log into Zoom using your Stanford email address.  Please see the [Zoom cheat sheet](https://uit.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2017/05/30/zoom-cheat-sheet.pdf) for details on how to do this.

## Grading

We will use a new method of grading in this course, known as *schedule-driven grading*.  There are several important aspects of this grading system:

- All assignments are graded for completion, rather than for correctness
- Every student starts the quarter with 105 points.  Every missed assignment results in the loss of 2.5 points.  The final grades are then determined by the number of points at the end of the quarter, using a standard scale (rounding fractional grades up to the nearest whole number):

    - 98- : A+
    - 92-97: A
    - 90-91: A-
    - 88-89: B+
    - 82-87: B
    - 80-81: B-
    - 78-79: C+
    - 72-77: C
    - 70-71: C-
    - 69-69: D+
    - 62-67: D
    - 60-61: D-
    - <60: NP

- All items in a week's module must be completed by Sunday evening of the following weekend; these deadlines are listed in Canvas and in the module schedule below.
- Every assignment must be submitted by the stated deadline to receive credit.  The only exceptions will be for students with excused absences (such as athletic trips), students with documented accomodations from the OAE, and students with documented illness.  Any accomodations must be discussed with the teaching team prior to the deadline; no exceptions will be made for work turned in after the deadline unless it was first cleared with the teaching team.

Under this grading system, *you always know what your grade is*, assuming that you complete all of the remaining assignments.

If you need an extension due to an absence for an official University trip, please log your absence *prior to your absence* using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScry4WeLeCOWchm9uBDzWkse7kCVbXUZbQOtiMKR4L4RnEBeA/viewform?usp=sf_link). You must complete this form *in advance* to receive the opportunity to make up in-class assessments. Athletes must include the name and email of their athletic advisor when providing a reason for their absence.

The components that will be graded include:

*Quizzes*: Every week there is a Canvas quiz that must be completed by the deadline.  You must score 100% on each quiz to receive credit - you can retake it as many times as necessary to get a perfect score.  In some cases the quizzes may include short answer questions; for these questions, credit will be obtained  by making a good faith effort to answer the question, even if the answer is factually incorrect. Short answer questions will be graded in the week following the due date, and students will be given an opportunity to revise any answers that are not considered sufficient.

*Problem sets*: Every other week there will be a R programming problem set due.  Problem sets will be graded for completion only, not for correctness.  We will attempt to provide feedback on individual assignments to help improve coding, but may be limited in our ability to do this for all students/problem sets.  The instructional team is always happy to meet to provide additional feedback on coding questions.  Please note that the problem set files will be automatically checked for plaigarism, and violators will be reported to the Office of Community Standards. 

*Lecture videos*: You must watch each of the lecture videos, which is assessed by completion of the  questions that are embedded in each of the lectures.  Each week's videos are worth 2.5 points in total; you must complete all of the videos to avoid losing the points for that week (i.e. there is no partial credit).

*Course meetings*: You must attend at least one synchronous course meeting each week, or complete a makeup assignment by the module deadline.  You will be responsible for self-reporting your attendance on Canvas; we expect you to be honest about your attendance, and will cross-check self-reported attendance against the Zoom records.

*Sections*: Sections will be focused on work related to the final project.  You must attend your weekly section meeting; if you cannot attend, you must communicate with your TA regarding how you coordinated with the group on the project that week.

*Final project*: Each student will participate in a group project with 3-4 other students. The project must test a set of specific hypotheses using a real world dataset.   The group must decide what hypotheses to test, and discuss the idea with their TA in section to get approval for the idea.  They must then do a literature review to find out what has been done on the question before, perform the analyses, and write a report on the results as well as provide the R code used to perform the entire analysis.  These reports will be peer-reviewed.  All groups will be expected to record a short virtual presentation on their results, as well as a written report.  There will be several milestones for the final project, which are included under the Final Project module on Canvas; each of these must be submitted by the deadline to avoid loss of credit.

There is no midterm or final examination for this class.

You can use any published resource you wish to complete the quizzes and problem sets (textbook, Internet, etc).  However, you should not discuss the answers with your fellow students unless instructed to do so by the instructors; sharing answers (including computer code) will be viewed as a violation of the Honor Code, and offending students will be reported to the Office of Community Standards. 


## Office hours

Prof. Poldrack will hold online co-working/office hours on Mondays from 8-9:30 AM PST, and Wednesdays 1-3 PM PST.  See Canvas for the Zoom link.  You should feel free to treat this as a co-working time; Prof. Poldrack will be there to answer questions as needed, but you can join and lurk without asking any questions if you wish.

Each of our TAs will also hold weekly office hours throughout the week. The Zoom links for each of the office hours can be found on the course's Canvas page.

## Using Google Colab

Problem sets and project analyses will be completed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is a freely available system for computatation notebooks.  Instructions for using Colab will be made available on Canvas. If you have problems accessing Google services from your geographical location, or privacy concerns regarding Google services, please contact Dr. Poldrack to discuss possible alternatives.

**Course Privacy Statement:**
As noted in the University’s recording and broadcasting courses policy, students may not audio or video record class meetings without permission from the instructor. If the instructor grants permission or if the teaching team posts videos themselves, students may keep recordings only for personal use and may not post recordings on the Internet, or otherwise distribute them. These policies protect the privacy rights of instructors and students, and the intellectual property and other rights of the university. Students who need lectures recorded for the purposes of an academic accommodation should contact the Office of Accessible Education. 

**Feedback:** We welcome student feedback regarding the course at any point.  Please feel free to email us directly, or leave anonymous feedback for the instructional team by using our [online form](https://poldracklab.wufoo.com/forms/m5bt5c407agqei/).

**Affordability:** Stanford University and its instructors are committed to ensuring that all courses are financially accessible to all students. If you are an undergraduate who needs assistance with the costs related to this class, you are welcome to approach me directly. If would prefer not to approach me directly, please note that you can ask the Diversity & First-Gen Office for assistance by completing their [questionnaire on course textbooks & supplies](http://tinyurl.com/jpqbarn) or by contacting Joseph Brown, the Associate Director of the Diversity and First-Gen Office (jlbrown@stanford.edu; Old Union Room 207). Dr. Brown is available to connect you with resources and support while ensuring your privacy.

**Respect for Diversity:**  It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and situations be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. We aim to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, which may include but not limited to: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religion, political affiliation, culture, and so on. We acknowledge that there is likely to be a diversity of access to resources among students and plan to support all of you as best as we can. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. 

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. In this class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be called and, if we choose, to identify pronouns with which we would like to be addressed. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and support classmates in doing so as well. 

**Code of conduct:** You are expected to treat the instructional team and your fellow students with courtesy and respect. This class should be a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religion, political affiliation, culture, or other personal characteristics.
